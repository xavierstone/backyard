I did not create a temporary facebook account, but I updated the code and it works perfectly with my account. If for some reason it doesn't work for you, just create a local account with the Create Account button to test the remainder of the features.

The map includes a current location feature, if you want to make use of this I suggest manually setting your location on the emulator to be somewhere around Lebanon, NH as this is the general area for most of the hard-coded campsites. Map-searching all results is a good way to orient yourself to the area.

The search term field searches for strings containing the provided term. It searches both site name and description. An empty term will return all results. The search menu gives the option of returning a list or results on a map.

The radius field specifies a range of latitude and longitude. I opted for this because the miles to lat/long conversion varies so much based on latitude.

To test the Gallery functionality, you will either have to manually upload images to the emulator or make use of Android's interesting Camera emulator. Both of these involve workarounds, but on a real phone it would be very straightforward.
